**Our ambition is to build a comprehensive data source and online data
analysis tools for the European music industry. This requires a map of
the music ecosystem — we need to understand where value is created and
money is exchanged, and we need to observe how much is this value and
how much is being paid for it.**

The value chain is a concept describing the full chain of a businesses'
activities in the creation of a product or service – from the initial
reception of materials all the way through its delivery to market, and
everything in between. Some services, like car manufacturing and banking
services, are offered by a large corporation that creates the service
alone. The music industry is different. In Europe it comprises of
hundreds of thousands of freelancers, microenterprises, and a few
small-and medium sized or large enterprises that form a creative network
to deliver projects.

Our initial view of the European music value chain is depicted in the
chart. 

<td style="text-align: center;">{{< figure src="/blogposts_2022/Music_value_chain.png" caption="If you think we put something in the wrong place, or you do not find an activity important to you:  [let us know!](https://reprex.nl/#contact)." numbered="false" >}}</td>

Our value chain model was perfected in various research and development
projects that aimed to understand the problems and increase the revenues
of the
[Hungarian](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/made_in_hungary/),
[Slovak](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/),
[Croatian](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/),
and
[UK](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/mce_empirical_streaming_2021/)
music industries. We have asked over 8 years more than 4000 music
professionals in 12 countries about how they work and how they get paid
(See our [Central European Music Industry
Report](https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/supply.html).)

It is based on the standard, accepted description of the music industry
with the “three revenue stream model” in the United States (Hull et al.
2011) and the European Union (Leurdijk et al. 2012; Leurdijk and Ottilie
2012). It is built upon the actual application of competition law in EU
jurisdictions (Antal 2017, 2019), and it is intended for further
research and publication.

The value chain is a good tool to localize information sources and plan
to collect data in a systematic way. For example, in the case of our
music value chain we must focus on some challenges:

- [x]   Unlike in other industries, most hours of music are listened to
    without paying consumers (radio, YouTube, ad-supported streams, home
    copying, torrenting). Understanding the advertising revenue streams
    is important.

-  [x]  The music industry is both very local and global. Small labels sell
    all over the world on digital platforms. But they should focus on
    markets where there is an interest for their music or where the
    prices are high, where they have a real chance to get playlisted.

-  [x] We must understand why some languages, or women are disadvantaged in
    this value chain, and what intervention can help this situation.

The aim of our mapping is to help the industry solve real problems: keep
its revenues in line with the growth of uses in more and more electronic
gadgets where people use music, compensate home copying, or close the
value gap, or find out where women get underpaid or underrepresented.
Our value chain helps us designing data collection plans for complex
analysis of music uses, prices and revenues that we will introduce in a
subsequent blogpost.
