On behalf of the Digital Music Observatory, the [Cultural & Creative Sectors and Industries Observatory](https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/), and the forming [OpenMuse](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/project/openmuse/) consortium, Daniel Antal and Maria Bartekova, PhD presented our invitation for an open collaboration for the Slovak Ministry of Culture, the ICP.Institute for Cultural Policies - Via Cultura, and various statistical, creative industry and music stakeholders to participate in an open collaboration with us, and try out the Open Policy Analysis framework.

In the joint presentation, we have shown how the Slovak music organizations, particularly SOZA contributed to the development of some best European data practices in music valuation, and understanding the problems created by autonomous systems, such as the recommender systems of global music streaming platforms.

We invited the Slovak cultural policy stakeholders to use our economic indicator design and automatic reporting capabilities in their work from January 2023.  Furthermore, we emphasized the importance of synchronizing the knowledge about Slovak music on the knowledge graphs of web 3.0.
