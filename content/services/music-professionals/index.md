The Digital Music Observatory aims to close the data gaps in the European music sector; this requires cooperation. In 2023, we reached the point when digital streaming platforms received up to 100,000 new recordings every single day—more than the entire catalogue of smaller European nations in the period of 1940-2000, from jazz through rock'n'roll to techno. As AI bots produce more and more recordings, it is a community challenge to grab visibility for every human musician's new work. 

We cannot effectively help individual musicians, bands, orchestras, ensembles, only city-, genre-, or national communities. However, in the countries where we do research and development (Baden-Würtemberg, Bulgaria, Hamburg, Hungary, Slovakia), we can help even individual artists and bands if they are willing to become our community ambassadors in our Listen Local outreach that want to make your regions's music more accessible to local audiences, tourists visiting, hotels, restaurants, radio stations, festival promoters and playlist curators.
